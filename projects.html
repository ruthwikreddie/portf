            <h3>Bucket List Tracker</h3>
            <p>
                Built and deployed a serverless web application on AWS Amplify for users to create and manage their bucket lists. Implemented scalable GraphQL APIs using AWS AppSync to allow precise and efficient data retrieval and management. Used DynamoDB to store bucket list items securely and at scale, ensuring quick and reliable access to data. Developed an ability for users to store images in Amazon S3 natively, which made for a natural interface of image upload and access. Improved efficiency on the project by using AWS CLI for an easier service configuration and deployment.

            <h3>Next-Gen Banking Platform</h3>
            <p>
                I led the development of a next-gen banking platform, leveraging more than 5 key features through Java Spring Boot and React.js. I enhanced Docker for improved CI/CD efficiency and scalability during deployment to guarantee reliability. Additionally, I optimized data management through a secure SQL Server database to ensure safeguarding and guarantee data integrity. I also architected microservices in Java Spring Boot, enabling seamless feature integration. Through UI and backend optimization, I increased processing speed by 30% and user satisfaction by 40%.

            <h3>Gas Transmission Replacement</h3>
            <p>
                I migrated SAP-managed site data to an Oracle database using Oracle Fusion Management along with Liferay-based REST services. I developed rich REST services for complex retrieval of asset hierarchies that integrate Gas Quality Systems together with equipment data. Additionally, I designed and validated the Asset Management UI in Angular 5, ensuring a seamless user experience during data entry. I also converted SOAP to JSON for better accessibility of data from the front end. Furthermore, I replicated SAP functionality (Webdynpro JAVA, ABAP RFCs) in the new Liferay system, replaced SAP PI middleware with Oracle Fusion for faster data processing, and integrated Angular with Liferay while automating Gradle tasks using Jenkins.            </p>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Liferay 7.0, Angular 5, Webdynpro JAVA, ABAP</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>E-Farming Android Application</h3>
            <p>
                I leveraged advanced ML models, including SVM and Random Forests, to improve crop yield prediction accuracy by 25%. Additionally, I enhanced data integrity using Firebase Cloud storage and efficient API integration, which contributed to a 20% increase in farming efficiency within the first year, benefiting a platform with 5,000 users.</p>
